message = '''Guts and hope. As Indians, we have both of these traits in abundance. 
Sometimes these illustrious traits lead us to wonderful outcomes, and in other instances to foolish ones. 
What else would explain the current COVID mess that we have landed ourselves in, 
where we now boast of the largest number of positive cases in the world. But then, we have God on our side. 
Clearly, when we thronged in millions at the Kumbh Mela during a pandemic, we believed God would save us from any harm. 
Guess what, he didnâ€™t. But, fortunately, something else probably will. 
We have hope and we will show courage in the face of adversity to find innovative solutions. 
That is what we do as Indians. We will find a way through this mess, together.'''
